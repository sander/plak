# Plak

Run a local webserver in Windows to use the copypaste clipboard in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

```
$ wpaste > ~/clipboard-contents
$ fortune | wcopy
```

## Installation in Windows

1. Press Windows + R, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
2. With the right mouse button, drag `Plak.Windows.exe` to your Startup folder and choose *Create shortcuts here*.
3. You may want to change the port number from the default (9001). To do so, press Alt + Enter and add a port number to Target, e.g. `C:\Plak.Windows.exe 8080`.
4. Launch the shortcut.

Note that `Plak` runs in the background. If you want to stop using Plak, use Task Manager to end the `Plak.Windows` task.

## Installation in Ubuntu

### Bash

Add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
PLAKPORT=9001
alias wcopy="curl -s -X PUT \
 -H 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8' \
 http://localhost:${PLAKPORT}/clipboard \
 --data-binary @-"
alias wpaste="curl -s http://localhost:${PLAKPORT}/clipboard"
```

### Emacs

Add to your init file:

```elisp
(defvar plak-port 9001)
(defun wcopy ()
  "Copies with Plak"
  (interactive)
  (shell-command-on-region (region-beginning) (region-end)
    (concat "curl -s -X PUT "
            "-H 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8' "
            "http://localhost:" (number-to-string plak-port) "/clipboard "
            "--data-binary @-")))
(defun wpaste ()
  "Pastes with Plak"
  (interactive)
  (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat "curl -s http://localhost:"
                                           (number-to-string 9001)
                                           "/clipboard"))))
```

Now you can use or keymap the `wcopy` and `wpaste` commands.
